# CHAPTER 1
## CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS

### 1.1 System Overview
1.1.1. RTES is an enhancement of the overall security system for protecting critical assets. Their primary functions are to provide final denial fire, area denial, and deny unauthorized personnel from avenues of approach to restricted/limited/exclusion areas.

1.1.2. **(DCNI)** RTES is employed by system operators to locate, identify, target and engage an adversary attacking the Kirtland Underground Munitions and Maintenance Storage Complex (KUMMSC). Employment and operational direction of the RTES will be the responsibility of the Security Forces (SF) on-scene commander. Close attention will be paid to the effects of base operations when utilizing the RTES. Rules of Engagement (ROE) in this instruction will specify when and how the RTES functions are used.

### 1.2. (DCNI) System Description: 
The RTES EMploys the M240B machine gun with 200 rounds of 7.62mm linked armor piercing/tracer ammunition. The RTES consoles, and all the M240B machine guns associated with them are not tied into the Automated/Advanced Entry Control System (AECS). These weapons are mounted within ballistic shielded clamshells on three hardened towers dispersed within the controlled area and two platforms within the KUMMSC/limited area, covering the loading dock. The RTES is remotely operated from the operator console located in the RTES Room (#150) adjacent to the Site Security Control Center (SSCC). Each tower on topside is equipped with two weapon systems and associated cameras.
